This repository is a companion to the book [Modern Networking - Fundamental Concepts](https://modern-networking.com). Here you'll find [FAQs](faqs.md) that expand on topics from the book, clarify tricky concepts, and answer common reader questions—along with code examples and other materials that may be updated regularly.

If you have a question that isn't covered in the FAQs, feel free to open an issue—we'd love to hear from you!
